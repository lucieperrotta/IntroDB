      "The company commonly referred to as \"DC\" has a somewhat complex beginning.  Its earliest predecessor was founded by Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson as National Allied Publications Inc.  Eventually circumstances led Wheeler-Nicholson to form a partnership with printer Harry Donenfeld and eventually accountant Jack Liebowitz to produce his third title Detective Comics.  This partnership was Detective Comics Inc. and was the first direct corporate predecessor of today's DC.By 1938 mounting debts forced Wheeler-Nicholson to sell his share of Detective Comics Inc. and then to declare bankruptcy losing control of his own Nicholson Publishing Co. Inc. the final direct successor to National Allied.  Donenfeld Liebowitz and Donenfeld's silent partner Paul Sampliner promptly bought Nicholson Publishing's two titles at bankruptcy auction and transferred them over to Detective Comics Inc.Later Max Charles Gaines would partner with Liebowitz to start up All-American Comics sharing distribution and staff with Donenfeld's operation.  Except for issues cover-dated 1945 All-American books would share the same logos and branding as Detective Comics Inc. and its corporate siblings.  For 1945 All-American behaved more as a separate publisher.  Also during that year Gaines published his first title using Educational Comics Inc. as the publishing company with an \"EC\" logo.  By the end of the year Gaines sold his share of All-American back to Liebowitz and Donenfeld and went on to build EC into a separate company.Eventually Donenfeld and Liebowitz consolidated all of their companies including those from All-American into National Comics Publications Inc.  Prior to that consolidation the companies group as follows:Owned solely by Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson:* National Allied Publications Inc. (1935)* National Allied Newspaper Syndicate Inc. (1935 - 1936)* More Fun Magazine Inc. (1936)* Nicholson Publishing Co. Inc. (1936 - 1938)A few issues were published by \"A.I. Menin rec. Nicholson Publishing Co. Inc.\" during the bankruptcy proceedings in 1938.Owned by Donenfeld Liebowitz and/or Sampliner (Detective Comics Inc. was initially co-owned by Wheeler-Nicholson and Liebowitz but the former was forced out in 1938):* Detective Comics Inc. (1937 - 1947)* Superman Inc. (1940 - 1947)* World's Best Comic Company (1941 - 1947)* Tilsam Publications (1943 - 1948)All-American companies under M. C.

      "Centaur consisted of Centaur Publications Inc. and the Comics Corporation of America.  Comics published by both of these publishers were advertised together and referred to as being published by the \"Centaur Group\" in those ads.Several additional companies have historically been lumped under \"Centaur\" on the grounds that the titles they published were later purchased and continued by Centaur Publications Inc.  The earliest of these were the Comics Magazine Company Inc. and Chesler Publications Inc. both of which sold titles to Ultem Publications Inc.  Many sources include these predecessors as Centaur issues but the companies are all distinct.Ultem in turn sold all four of their titles to Joseph Hardie and Raymond Kelly's Centaur Publications Inc. which had been publishing pulp magazines since at least 1933.  Centaur used these to begin their comic book line and also drew on the back inventory of stories to fill out the early issues of their new titles with reprints.  Comic Corporation of America began with Amazing Man Comics in 1939 but did not add other titles until after Centaur Publications Inc. had ceased production at the end of 1940.By many accounts Centaur's titles suffered from poor distribution and as the U. S. was drawn into World War II they ceased publication.  Some of their final issues were projects for the Chicago Mail Order Co.  \"C-M-O Comics\" was published for them (but not by the Chicago Mail Order Co. contrary to some sources) while Liberty Guards Comics may have been published directly by the Chicago Mail Order Co.  Even less is known about a third possible CMO-related title Khaki Komics.  All of these issues except possibly Khaki Komics may have been published later in 1942 than the last regularly dated titles.Comic Corporation of America continued on as a publisher of non-comics titles.  Two other Hardie / Kelly companies Harle Publications Inc. (seen in the statement of ownership of Funny Picture Stories v3#1) and H-K Publications Inc. would publish a few comics in the 1950's but mostly published other sorts of magazines.Other Hardy / Kelly publishers:Harle Publications: http://www.comics.org/publisher/2596/H-K Publications: http://www.comics.org/publisher/4030/Publishers who published titles that Centaur later bought:Ultem: http://www.comics.org/publisher/7631/Chesler: http://www.comics.org/publisher/112/Comics Magazine Company: http://www.comics.org/publisher/7628/",NULL

Delacorte Jr. (managing editor).(Information from \"The American Comic Book: The Evolutionary Era 1884-1939\" by Denis Gifford.)Dell was founded in 1921 and first published comics with the original 1929-30 run of \"The Funnies\" which looked like a newspaper insert but was distributed on newsstands.  Eastern Color Printing Company was involved with several of Dell's earliest comic book ventures although the exact nature of each partnership is not always clear.  Later Dell worked closely with Western to produce a line a comics before Dell produced a line of comics wholly on their own for about a decade. The company's comic book division folded in 1973 although Dell continued to publish the occasional book with comics content including newspaper strip collections.  Dell became part of Bantam Doubleday Dell (http://www.comics.org/publisher/5554/) in 1988 ceasing to exist as an independent company.Dell's first three regular titles -- Popular Comics (February 1936) The Funnies (October 1936) and The Comics (March 1937) -- were packaged and printed by M.C. Gaines at the McClure Syndicate offices. These followed Gaines' early format for Famous Funnies by using newspaper-strip reprints.Around 1936 Dell started to work with Western (also known as Western Printing and Lithographing Company a Racine Wisconsin firm) first using Western's plant in Poughkeepsie New York as their printer.  Dell turned over production duties on Popular Comics and The Funnies to Western in 1939. In 1944 they formalized their arrangement with Dell financing the comics and Western providing the editorial work and the printing. Western retained complete control over select titles such as Red Ryder and Walt Disney's Comics and Stories though even those titles carried the Dell emblem after 1948.(Some of the information for the above from Funnybooks: The Improbable Glories of the Best American Comic Books by Michael Barrier and Mark Evanier's \"News from Me\" blog [http://www.newsfromme.com/iaq/iaq07/])*******  \"© Robert S.

      "Holyoke was originally a printer and was owned by Sherman Bowles.  It became a publisher by taking over both titles published by Frank Z. Temerson's Helnit Publishing Co.  Helnit's editorial staff (most notably principal artist Charles Quinlan) came with the titles and continued to produce both books.  Slightly later Holyoke also acquired Blue Beetle from the now-defunct Fox Publications and continued it with slightly different contents some produced by the editorial staff inherited from Helnit.  Holyoke lost the Helnit books after cover date January 1943.  Temerson would resume publishing them himself several months later.  They retained Blue Beetle until 1944 at which point Victor Fox regained control of Blue Beetle through court action.  Holyoke essentially relaunched the series two months later as Sparkling Stars consisting of Blue Beetle's backup features which had never been published by Fox.The so-called \"Holyoke One-Shots\" are included here mostly by convention.  They are really repackaging of early Temerson material (from Helnit Tem and possibly other companies).  They have absolutely no title printing publication or copyright information printed on them and may well have been produced by someone other than either Temerson or Holyoke.  However Mike Tiefenbacher pinned the name on them several decades ago and it has stuck.  The two \"Veri Best\" titles are also unconfirmed as Holyoke but at least one of them seems to reprint Holyoke material.Site visitors may also want to look at the publisher entry for Temerson / Helnit / Continental which goes into more detail about those companies and several others that were or were thought to be related to Temerson and Holyoke:http://www.comics.org/publisher/129/This essay built on research by Frank Motler Bob Hughes Jim Vadeboncoeur Jr. Hames Ware Henry Andrews and other GCD and Digital Comic Museum contributors.",NULL

      "Harry \"A\" Chesler (the \"A\" was not a proper initial- supposedly Chesler claimed it stood for \"Anything\") was a comic book packager and publisher.  He operated a packaging studio more or less continuously from the mid-30s through 1953 and at times also operated as a publisher.  He first published two oversize comics Star Comics and Star Ranger as Chesler Publications in 1937.  He sold this venture to Ultem Publications but continued to produce the comics (now normal sized) as well as two additional titles that Ultem had acquired.  All of Ultem's comics were entirely put together by Chesler and continued the trade dress of his early books.After Ultem sold its titles to Centaur Chesler spent the next several years packaging comics for other publishers and selling them individual stories.  One such comic was a 1938 giveaway for Cocomalt which is included here because it has no other publishing information beyond Chesler's copyright.  While some sources list Chesler as publishing or co-owning early Quality Comics issues this is not correct.  At most he supplied them with a few stories.In 1941 Chesler returned as a publisher with Dynamic Publications Inc.  From this point on most of Chesler's comics would be branded with a logo proclaiming them the \"World's Greatest Comics\".  In 1941-1942 this also identified each issue as \"A Dynamic Publication\".  After just over half a year the U. S. was ramping up its involvement in World War II and Dynamic ceased publishing producing a few books through surrogates.The surrogate activity picks up dramatically in 1944 leading into Chesler's third major wave of publishing.  In place of \"A Dynamic Publication\" these had \"Harry \"A\" Chesler Jr.\".  Junior however was the son of Chesler the publisher a point of much confusion for latter-day comics researchers.  This period lasted through 1946 after which the ongoing titles were continued in Canada by Superior Publishers through early 1948.  Chesler continued to run his art shop but no longer published his own comics after 1946.Related Publishers:Ultem: http://www.comics.org/publisher/7631/Superior Publishers Limited: http://www.comics.org/publisher/223/",NULL

      "This group of publishers centers around Frank Z. Temerson and includes many that have long been erroneously considered part of Holyoke.  In truth like Victor Fox's pre and post-war companies and the Blue Beetle series Temerson lost control of Cat-Man Comics and Captain Aero Comics to Holyoke and then re-emerged and reclaimed them a year or so later.  The exact relationship between Temerson and Holyoke (formerly just a printer and owned by one Sherman Bowles) remains unclear.  The transfer from Temerson to Holoyoke happened almost without disruption in publication but the return transfer involved a large gap.Temerson had previously been active in comic book publishing in 1937 in partnership with I. W. Ullman under the name Ultem Publications Inc. with Harry \"A\" Chesler serving as editor and content producer.  They soon sold their titles to Centaur Publications and reorganized Ultem as Lex Publications which did not produce comics.Temerson probably resurfaces in 1939 with Brookwood Publishing Co. Inc. which is currently grouped under Harvey as that is where its sole title ultimately ended up.  It shares an editorial address 381 Fourth St. New York N. Y. with his next few companies all of which are found here.  However it's lone title Speed Comics was edited by Maurice Rosenfield nephew of I. W. Ullman so the Temerson connection is unclear.Getting to the more certain Temerson companies Tem Publishing Co. Inc. and Nita Publishing Co. Inc. ran concurrently publishing one title each for a few months in 1940.  Immediately after the last issue from these he began publishing Green Hornet Comics under the name Helnit Publishing Co. Inc. the business name he would use until losing his titles to Holyoke.  All of these exhibit Temerson's fondness for using syllables from his and others names to name companies.  \"Tem\" is obvious but the significance of \"Nit\" and \"Hel\" are not yet known.Note that several other companies ran concurrent with Tem and Nita and were frequently grouped with them (often as Holyoke).  These are all in fact associated with Worth Carnahan and may be found under that publisher.  The error derived from artist Charles Quinlan playing a major role both in Carnahan's companies and then at Helnit and Holyoke and for the coincidental similarity of Temerson's title \"Whirlwind Comics\" (featuring a character named Cyclone) with Carnahan's \"Cyclone Comics\".",NULL

In 1916 they acquired the assets of the failed publisher Hamming-Whitman Publishing Co. which they made a subsidiary of Western under the name Whitman Publishing Co.Under the Whitman publishing wing Western produced Big Little Books beginning in 1932 and Little Golden Books beginning in 1938.  Over these years Western began to acquire the licenses to produce publications featuring the stars of the Disney Warner Bros. M-G-M and Walter Lantz studios.Around 1936 Western began to work with Dell printing their established comics titles like The Funnies and Popular Comics at Western's Poughkeepsie New York printing plant. Not long after starting to produce comics of their own such as Super Comics and Crackajack Funnies Western also assumed complete production duties over these Dell titles in 1939. In 1944 Dell and Western formalized their partnership to produce a line of standard newsstand comic books with Dell generally providing the financing and distribution while Western produced the contents and printed the comics.  Many of these comics featured the characters licensed by Western.  Some of these licensed comics however were wholly produced and financed separately from Dell by K. K. Publications Inc.  When licensing agent Kay Kamen sold Western a licensing deal with Disney he arranged a special partnership agreement that resulted in the formation of this publisher.  These comics were produced and printed by Western and distributed by Dell but technically published by K. K. Publications.  Since K. K. Publications' titles Red Ryder and Walt Disney's Comics and Stories are commonly thought of as Dell comics due to the Dell logo on the covers after 1948 these comics can be found in this database under the Dell master publisher.  This arrangement between Western and Dell lasted until 1962.",NULL

Gordon and Gotch is now part of the PMP Group and remains Australia's largest independent distributor and wholesaler of printed media.Australian regulation required the distributor to be named on periodicals resulting in a dominant Gordon and Gotch credit on most Australian comics including many covers. Some smaller companies around the 1950s had no cover branding with limited or no indicia occasionally with the publication information in the middle pages of the comic. As a result some comics readers incorrectly assume Gordon and Gotch is the comic's publisher particularly if they only have a cover scan to work from.",732

The International Publishing Corporation Ltd was formed in 1963 following the merger of the UK's three leading magazine publishers -- George Newnes Odhams Press and Fleetway Publications -- who came together with the Mirror Group to form the International Publishing Corporation (IPC). And IPC Magazines was created five years later in 1968. But those three original magazine businesses each had their own illustrious history having been established in 1881 1890 and 1880 respectively with a number of the titles they launched in the late 19th Century still being published today under the IPC umbrella. And when The Field launched in 1853 joined the IPC stable in 1994 following the acquisition of Harmsworth Magazines it saw our family tree reach back even further. from www.ipcmedia.com/about/companyhistory.phpFor the purposes of the GCD the IPC master publisher begins in 1959 when The Mirror Group purchases AP (The Amalgamated Press) publishers of titles like Knockout Sun Comet Cowboy Picture Story Thriller Picture Library and Super Detective Library.  In 1961 The Mirror Group took over Longacre Press (previously Odhams Press) including their long-running title Eagle.  In 1963 the Mirror Group was renamed International Publishing Corporation Ltd (IPC).  The Fleetway name a holdover from AP was still used to identify the comics magazine publishing arm of IPC although some comics were published in IPC's name.In 1987 IPC sold its comics division to Robert Maxwell who continued to publish the comics under the Fleetway name.",NULL

Canadian Golden-Age publisher of original material and then of reprints of American comics from various publishers.Bell's output can be divided into 4 time periods.The first and arguably the most important period is from 1941 to early 1946. During this time Bell produced 100% Canadian comics known popularly as Canadian Whites (even though a few of the early ones were actually in full colour).The second period is a very short time in 1946 when Bell was producing comics for the British market. These normally had an original Canadian cover with a reprint of a contemporary U.S. comic inside.After this was the third period where Bell reprinted U.S. comics with covers from the U.S. comics themselves. Comics from Archie Marvel Quality and other U.S. publishers were common. Sometimes the comic being reprinted had the correct cover sometimes it didn't. This period was from approximately 1948 to 1951.The fourth period is after 1951. Bell continued to reprint U.S. comics but mostly under different titles and covers from the original U.S. comics. Splash pages were modified to serve as covers or illustrations from one company were combined with logos from another and some of the titles and logos from the Canadian Whites were revived.Besides a few of the very early Canadian Whites a few of the British exports and a couple of the earliest U.S. reprints Bell did not include dates in the comics. The estimated dates are based primarily on the earliest possible date based on what is being reprinted. The estimated dates of other issues in the series are also taken into account as well as the existence of date stamps. It is quite possible that some comics were actually published months or even a year or two after our estimated date.",NULL

The company began as \"Wiley & Putnam\" with the 1838 partnership between George Palmer Putnam and John Wiley. In 1841 Putnam went to London UK where he set up a branch office the first American company to ever do so. In 1848 he returned to New York where he dissolved the partnership with John Wiley and established \"G. Putnam Broadway\" publishing a variety of works including quality illustrated books.On George Palmer Putnam's death in 1872 his sons George H. John and Irving inherited the business and the firm's name was changed to \"G. P. Putnam's Sons.\" Son George H. Putnam would be made president of the firm a position he held for the next fifty-two years. On his death in 1930 the various Putnam heirs voted to merge the firm with Minton Balch & Co. who became the majority stockholders. In 1965 G.P. Putnam's Sons acquired Berkley Books a mass market paperback publishing house. Ten years later Putnam Publishing Group and Berkley Publishing Group were sold to MCA Inc. In 1982 Putnam acquired the respected children's book publisher Grosset & Dunlap.In 1996 the company was bought by the Penguin Group a division of the British publishing conglomerate Pearson PLC. The new owners merged Putnam/Berkley with Penguin USA to form Penguin Putnam Inc. who use the name to publish the \"G.P. Putnam's Sons Books for Young Readers.\"\"",NULL

Almost none of them have dates in the actual comics so all dates given here are estimates.The date estimates are based on a number of factors:1) The date of the material being reprinted (only applies to pre-1971 comics)2) The cover price of the comic (some comics are double priced with pre-decimal and decimal prices so they have been dated as 1971 when the currency changed)3) Ally Sloper is known to have been published in 1976. Amazing Stories of Suspense #151 is known to have an ad for Ally Sloper so it has been given a date of 1976. It was also the first issue in its series to have a price of 15p so comics in other series have been dated relative to that.4) Changes in brand and price have been used for approximate dating of comics from 1971 on.Alan Class was not a traditional publisher sticking to any sort of schedule. From interviews it appears he would print up comics when he ran out of stock often re-using the same covers and interiors he had used before (it doesn't appear he acquired any new material after early 1970).",NULL

SPM ran for almost two years before coming to a stop though all contents can be found in the archives of indyshow.com. Almost a year after the magazines demise it is still remembered fondly from various publishers and creators that still beg for its return.Before the end of SPM Rorschach Entertainment began gearing up to enter the comic book market as a publisher which finally came to fruition in late 2003 with the release of Sprecken: The Destiny Dance  from http://rorschachentertainment.com/info/aboutus.html",917

It was at the Las Vegas Comic Con in December of 1996 with the help of a whole lot of Caffeine and a whole lot of no sleep that they laid the groundwork for the stories Dark Tarot\" and \"Dragoons\". In 1997 both stories were offered to their publisher at the time as mini series' but were told that for various reasons they would not publish either story. After having developed some 5 separate stories for their former publisher already and not having a single one published their frustration peaked at the 1997 San Diego Comic Con when the comment was made that for any of their stories to see print they would have to do it publish it themselves. And so in the summer of 1998 Lee and Dennis left built their OWN sandbox and thus BloodFire Studios was born.

Entre finales de 1979 y principios de 1980 las historietas en circulación llevaron ambos logos el de Vid y el de EDAR como se observa en \"Lagrimas y Risas # 878\". Tanto Editorial Vid como EDAR fueron fundadas y manejadas por los esposos Guillermo De La Parra y Yolanda Vargas Dulché quienes estuvieron en la industria de la Historieta desde la década de los 1940s. Desde 2012(?) después de perder todas las licencias de publicación de editoriales extranjeras estaba inactiva por un tiempito pero hoy en dia sigue en operacion. A finales de ese mismo año de 2012 se funda Kamite Comics (http://www.comics.org/publisher/8443/) gracias a la iniciativa de sus ex-empleados. Kamite publica algunos revistas de Editorial Vid en forma digital.Grupo Editorial Vid is a Mexican Publisher founded in 1980 (after Editorial Argumentos ceased operations).  It remains active currently reprinting Mexican-created comics originally published by its predecessor company (Editorial Argumentos).  In the 1980s and 1990s it also licensed translated printed and distributed American Comic Books from important Publishers such as DC Marvel Image Darkhorse Crossgen among others; as well as Japanese Manga from Shueisha.

Issues usually have no cover price but are priced 10¢ in the indicia and have subscription information in US dollars. Advertising is generally in Spanish but is for American companies.

In fact it was a distinct company formed by William H. Cook and John F. Mahon. Cook and Mahon had been the managing editor and business manager respectively of National Allied Newspaper Syndicate and More Fun Magazines (Maj. Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson's second batch of companies and early predecessors of DC Comics).They left after only three months and started The Comics Magazine which included many features from National drawn by the original artists.  Exactly what happened is not clear.  A common story has been that they took the finished artwork in lieu of payment but that does not explain why some artists moved over with them and continued to produce their features for several months.  Many of these were also continued at National by different artists and re-named characters.  Other features make a single appearance and then return to National.  And some artists continued to produce work for both companies.The Comics Magazine Company published their last issues cover-dated June 1937.  The two oldest titles were acquired by Ultem Publications and resumed with volume 2 three months later.  Ultem's titles were in turn acquired by Centaur half  a year later.Essay built on research by Bob Hughes Steven Rowe Frank Motler Henry Andrews and many others.For further information see the entry for Centaur:http://www.comics.org/publisher/58/",NULL

In 1937 they bought out Harry \"A\" Chesler's company Chesler Publications Inc. and William Cook and John Mahon's Comics Magazine Company Inc.  Ultem shrunk Chesler's oversize comics down to the standard size but kept Chesler on as editor and packager for both his former titles and the two former Comics Magazine titles that Ultem relaunched.  All four now featured Chesler's trade dress and Ultem's editorial address for its comics remained the same as Chesler's rather than moving to Ullman and Temerson's offices.Ultem published comics for only five months after which all four of its titles are sold to Centaur Publications Inc.  A few months after that Ultem reorganizes as Lex Publications which does not produce comics.  Temerson would go on to start a number of comic book publishing companies one of which (Brookwood) was edited by Maurice Rosenfield son of J. A. Rosenfield who was Ullman's brother-in-law.Ultem has historically often been lumped in with Centaur (along with the Comics Magazine Company and early Chesler) but the companies have distinct editorial personalities especially once Centaur starts building up its staff.Related publishers:Centaur: http://www.comics.org/publisher/58/Comics Magazine Company: http://www.comics.org/publisher/7628/Chesler: http://www.comics.org/publisher/112/Temerson / Helnit / Continental: http://www.comics.org/publisher/129/",NULL

The exact origin of these publisher names is not known although the links are clear through historical references common reprint sources (especially Harvey) shared addresses and similar cover styles. Some might have originally been separate companies acquired by Magazine Management. 'Magazine Management' is used on few comics although it is listed in the company's magazines during the 1960s and reflected in an \"MM\" code used in advertisements. During the 1970s US comics (particularly Harvey Dell and Gold Key) continued to be printed under the Rosnock and Jubilee names while Magazine Management imported millions of comics from the US and Europe (including rebinding old stock in new covers for the Australian market). The final related indicia publisher 'Magman International' was used on Disney reprints in 1984 which are the company's last comic publications.

John Ryan's history of Australian comics Panel by Panel reports that Magazine Management is a successor to Ayers & James; however the two were initially separate companies. Magazine Management purchased Ayers & James sometime after 1960. Magazine Management is not the US Marvel company of the same name. In fact the Australian company specifically changed its name to Magman because it was focused on children's reading at a time when the US company was producing adult magazines.",NULL

According to Peter Hansen as quoted in Ken Quattro's \"The Comics Detective\" blog Editors Press Service was formed by Joshua B. Powers publishing in the U.S. with T. V. Boardman distributing in the U.K.  Boardman also had is own U.K. publications (see http://www.comics.org/publisher/192/ )Years based on the known dates of the Australian version of WAGS which started before the British version and ended long after.  It seems likely that other comic publications (possibly strips rather than books) were distributed earlier as the company may have started as early as 1933 but nothing has yet been confirmed.Comics Detective blog entries:http://thecomicsdetective.blogspot.com/2010/03/wonderful-wags-of-oz.htmlhttp://thecomicsdetective.blogspot.com/2010/04/return-to-wonderful-wags-of-oz.html",NULL

      "Courtesy of http://www.guiadosquadrinhos.com/editora.aspx?cod_edi=2:\"Criada por Roberto Marinho em 30 de maio 1952. A RGE fazia parte das Organizações Globo mas não podia usar o nome “Globo” por já haver outra editora com aquele nome. Só passou a se chamar assim quando Marinho adquiriu em 1986 a gaúcha Editora Globo. Ainda como RGE publicou durante décadas os quadrinhos da King Features (“Fantasma” “Mandrake” “Flash Gordon”) e os da Harvey (“Brotoeja” “Riquinho”...). O reinado da King na RGE começou a fraquejar em 1968 quando a editora cancelou uma série de títulos que estavam sendo preteridos pela febre dos super-heróis Marvel e DC (a chamada “Batmania”) publicados pela concorrente Ebal. Dos heróis uniformizados da RGE só ficaram os mais populares como “Fantasma\" e “Cavaleiro Negro”. Da linha cômico-infantil também ficaram só os populares como “Recruta Zero” e “Riquinho”. “Fantasma” nos anos 60 foi o gibi mais bem sucedido de todos os tempos no Brasil. Gibi. Não estamos falando do “Suplemento” ou do “Globo Juvenil” tablóides de custo reduzido mas que mesmo assim talvez não vendessem igual ao “Fantasma”. Entre 1967-69 “Fantasma” vendia cerca de 200.000 exemplares por edição.Em meados dos anos 70 a RGE adotou o formatinho para a maioria dos seus gibis. Para muitos a decadência dos gibis de Marinho começou ali. Seguiram-se então uma série de erros como a reformulação desnecessária da revista “Sítio do Pica-Pau Amarelo” (que provocou debandada dos artistas nacionais da casa). Em 1979 a RGE adquiriu os direitos dos heróis Marvel (“Homem-Aranha” “Hulk” “Quarteto Fantástico”) lançando gibis mensais destes títulos além de alguns outros que reuniu em almanaques de periodicidade variada (com “X-Men” “Nova” “Mulher-Aranha”...). Assim como ocorreu no “Sítio” essas novas HQs não eram planejadas a médio ou longo prazo saindo a “toque de caixa”. Eram lançadas unicamente visando o bolso do leitor que logo percebeu o descaso fazendo as vendas caírem.\"",NULL

Canadian newspaper history is not an easy topic to research online. However a company called Herald Publishing appears to have existed in Toronto in 1914 and perhaps earlier. Another reference to \"The Herald\" makes it clear that it was one of two papers merged to form the Herald-Chronicle which presumably still exists. \"The Herald\" could be addressed sometime in about the 1940s at 2382 West Dundas St. Superior Publishing had the address 2382 Dundas St. West as did Herald Publishing Company in 1950/1951. It also seems likely that the same company published several \"Herald\" newspapers within a fairly short radius of Toronto.

Along the way the creator of the series Ryan Clements also put out a horror genre comic entitled The Pact - a demonic persona recruits estranged teens to do his evil bidding. Adam didn't realize what he was getting into but now he can't leave without Jean the girl of his dreams. The uniqueness of these comics is that they were published in newspaper format not book.

From 1938 the company expanded internationally and formed Australia's first national book chain during the 1970s.Over time the company changed hands to IPEC in 1976 and Gordon & Gotch in 1978 when A&R Publishing became a separate company. In 1990 A&R Publishing merged with Bookworld; was later purchased by New Zealand book retailer Whitcoulls Group in 1993; then by Blue Star Group in 1996; and then by UK's WHSmith in 2001. In 2004 A&R was acquired by Australian investment company Pacific Equity Partners. PEP purchased Borders in Australia and New Zealand in 2009 and brought the brands together under the parent company RedGroup Retail. In 2011 RedGroup went into administration leaving only an on-line A&R bookstore that later became part of Penguin Australia. In 2015 A&R was sold to online retailer Booktopia. The Angus & Robertson imprint is still used in books published by HarperCollins a News Corporation company.From the earliest days the company was a publisher as well as a bookseller noted for publishing and promoting many classic Australian authors including Banjo Patterson Henry Lawson May Gibbs Norman Lindsay and CJ Dennis.
