But after several delays Simon and Schuster decided it was not going to be publishing graphic novels and shelved it.  After about five years it was taken to DC and pitched as an Elseworlds book. Tom would be re-incarnated as Robin in the year 3000 and new material would be added to incorporate Batman and bracket the story.",
