Now for those not familiar with DC you probably think that only Paul Levitz has that power. Obviously you never met Alison. In describing Alison Gill I feel a little like the Burl Ives snowman describing Bumbles in Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer. As Vice President of Production Alison oversees the production of every comic original graphic novel and collected edition that DC prints. Not just DCU but Wildstorm Vertigo Minx CMX... everything. Simply put without Alison and her incredibly talented and overworked staff those lovely printed comics you buy every week would be filled with blank pages hell I couldn't even guarantee you'd get staples. Alison and her team allow us to push the deadline limits to make sure that you get the best book possible and that you get it on time. How else can we plan such elaborate crossovers (where timing is everything) like the ones between JUSTICE LEAGUE OF AMERICA JUSTICE SOCIETY OF AMERICA FLASH and COUNTDOWN (a time shattering story that will affect the lives of not 2 but 4 super teams) and GREEN LANTERN CORPS GREEN LANTERN and COUNTDOWN (where heroes becomes villains and villains grow more powerful). And don't get me started on how much extra they did to keep 52 on its weekly schedule. So I figure I best be nice after all COUNTDOWN starts the week after 52 ends (that's May 9th for those of you who were visiting Antarctica for the past month) and with our ambitious plan to sync up all the storytelling in the DCU for the next year so that events are seen across the universe moving in unison in \"real time\" we will be needing the strength and support of production more than ever. I once asked Alison how does her team do it? Magic she said. Makes sense to me.
