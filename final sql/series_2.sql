Tales to Astonish included an Ant-Man/Giant-Man feature in issues #35–69 (starring a character introduced in issue #27) a Wasp feature in issues #51–58 a Hulk feature from issue #60 (October 1964) and a Sub-Mariner feature from issue #70 (August 1966). Tales to Astonish introduced Hank Pym (Ant-Man/Giant Man) the Wasp and important Hulk villains such as the Leader and the Abomination. It is well known that Stan Lee (sometimes assisted by Larry Lieber or Lieber on his own) wrote the overwhelming majority of these early monster stories. Where there is no positive confirmation credits may be listed as \"Stan Lee ?; Larry Lieber ?\" or either person individually or simply \"?\" according to the indexer's best information.",

As Mastermind had not beenseen since the earliest issues of the X-men this series of reprints would have been a very subtle way to bring new fans up-to-speed regarding Mastermind's original appearance. This would prove to be a significant plot point within four issues.",

It also published material that regulars produced but for which Marvel had no place in the  regular publication schedule.  Editor Al Milgrom in May 2005 on Marvel Fanfare:  \"It was intended that [Marvel Fanfare] would appeal especially to the fans.  [I] tried to get the best possible stuff (as you say--by either established pros or talented newcomers).  At least part of the purpose was to use better paper more elaborate detailed coloring and by charging a higher cover price to eliminate all those unsightly ads.  The creators were paid a bonus 50% rate too.   I was sometimes 'accused' of just using up inventory material--as if that was necessarily a bad thing.  I did use some inventory stuff--if I thought it was of high enough quality.  As with any grand vision the results sometimes fell short of the goal.  But hey I tried.  It was sometimes difficult to keep on top of the book since I went off staff after awhile and had to try to coordinate its publication while working at home and juggling a full-time freelance career.  What finally killed it was the advent of incentive payments to freelancers--top creators could make far more than the rate-and-a-half Fanfare paid if they worked on many of the better selling regular titles.  That and my workload and family obligations made it tough to keep the book going.  And sales had begun to drop as well.\"  This information added 2005 by Steven Tice.",
