Vassallo agrees that this is possible in his blog entry on the USA Comics Masterworks Vol. 2 but also observes that the panel layouts in each story are typical of their year of publication so the later story was not an inventory piece held for several years before publication.  No known interior art by Schomburg from 1940 exists for comparison.Henry Andrews observes that Schomburg illustrating this story may explain why it was chosen for the cover feature but the depiction of a suit-wearing tommy gun-wielding Don Gorman on the cover is completely unlike the aviator character in this story which seems odd if both were produced by Schomburg.If this is by Schomburg it was almost certainly produced as a freelance job as Schomburg produced Timely's covers as a freelancer.
