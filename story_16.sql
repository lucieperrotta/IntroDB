Scott (1985). Script identification confirmed by David Porta December 2013.The genesis of the \"Chuckwagon Charley's Tales\" series dates to 1946 when Gaylord Du Bois as he recorded in his account books at the time sent off the script of the first episode of the series. One infers it would have gone to his editor at Western Oskar Lebeck. That story appeared in Animal Comics #27 (June-July 1947). The next seven episodes of the series were recorded by Du Bois in his account books as \"For Animal Comics\" and the next three episodes (CCT#2 CCT#3 CCT#4) all did appear in Animal Comics (AC#28 AC#29 AC#30) but Animal Comics #30 was the last issue of that comic (it was canceled) and the four remaining scripts of Chuckwagon Charley's Tales episodes written for Animal Comics were published in the Roy Rogers Comics reboot series beginning with Roy Rogers Comics #1 here (as noted elsewhere Roy Rogers Comics ran for 13 issues under the Four Color Comics numbering before the reboot under its own title and new numbering). Du Bois's account books reflected the transition with his entry for \"Chuckwagon Charley #9.  6p.  For Roy Rogers Comics June issue.  Sent October 27 1947.\" (As it appears on page 95 of Gaylord Du Bois's Account Books Sorted by Title compiled from the original account books by Randall W.  Scott.) >> The series ran for ten years in Roy Rogers Comics straight on through Roy Rogers and Trigger #128 NovDec58 but remained true to its genesis as a feature in Animal Comics: Chuckwagon Charley's tales always concerned animals. It was an animal comics feature. >> Genesis of the \"Chuckwagon Charley's Tales\" feature provided by David Porta December 2013.It was anonymously noted here previously that \"It is believed that the first three of these [Chuckwagon Charley] stories were either submitted as 'Bunkhouse Harmonies' or the first four tales were not written by Du Bois and his 'Bunkhouse Harmonies' were not used.\" While we now know that \"the first four tales\" of Chuckwagon Charley in Roy Rogers #1234 (Chuckwagon Charley episodes #5678) WERE written by Du Bois and were simply imported from the stock written for Animal Comics that note reflected the fact that in the ROY ROGERS section of Randy Scott's \"Gaylord Du Bois's Account Books Sorted by Title compiled from the original account books by Randall W. Scott (1985)\" there appear on page 94 three entries of a feature entitled \"Bunkhouse Harmonies\" all of them being 6 page episodes. >> The title \"Bunkhouse Harmonies\" suggests to this writer that it was in keeping with the theme of Roy Rogers as a singing cowboy. What were those 6-page episodes of Bunkhouse Harmonies? Santa Claus Funnies contained illustrated Christmas Carols. Might Bunkhouse Harmonies have involved traditional public domain western folk songs? Were those three \"Bunkhouse Harmonies\" episodes ever published in any venue? >> \"Bunkhouse Harmonies\" research and commentary provided by David Porta December 2013.",19

Pencil credit is still in question. Back when Jerry Bails did his original \"Authoritative Index to All-Star Comics\" he listed Hasen as the penciler. Jerry owned the original cover at that time.   Years later in 1976 when I did the \"All-Star Comics Revue\"  I told Jerry that it looked like Peddy did the pencils citing various reasons and he agreed that it could have been him so the credit was changed to Peddy. Hasen later denied doing the cover to me so that change stayed in place.  Before Jerry's death he sold me the original cover to AS #49......which I later sold to a friend back East and that person knowing Hasen personally showed it to Hasen at a show. This time Hasen stated that he did the cover.  Studying the various aspects of the art very closely the figures of Wonder Woman GL and Flash all carry \"signatures\" of both Peddy as well as Hasen being the penciler.  What makes this the more difficult is the excellent inking of Bernard Sachs who inked both pencilers over the years. That inking may very well hide tell-tale clues that would pin-point either Peddy or Hasen as the true penciler since Hasen has said \"no he didn't do it and then \"yes\" he did do it.  So I am adding Hasen back along with Peddy and both with a ?. Added by Craig Delich 2014-1-30.",6

The profiles hands panel compositions are all his. What may be causing the confusion is the inking by Bob Lander.

Lander also inked Irwin Hasen on earlier appearances of this strip so there's some similarity in the finished faces. Elias was drawing stories for Kanigher (Danger Trail Flash) during this period.
