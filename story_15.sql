Several facts point to that. The faces in close up in all these Tommy Paige stories are the same shape narrower chin and jaw than Albright's more rounded in her signed stories of The Cadet in 4Most Comics. The overlip in the Allison close ups are always formed either thin black waves or an open waved outline while Albright just made an even line (males) never waves or outline. Allison had several small ink lines on the cheekbones but Albright usually made one arch or none at all. The ears of Allison usually had several lines inside often non-connected while Albright most often used two Cs or a continuous S-figure.Allison had a funny way of drawing running people with outstretched legs really stepping on it with Albright a bit more realistic.Allison had eyes in close up with pupils very thin wavy eyebrows pointed at each end while Albright had eyebrows a little thicker by the nose.Albright and Allison can be very difficult to separate. The artwork on the first four Tommy Paige stories is by the same artist and the first is credited to Allison by Jim Vadeboncoeur Jr. So if JVJ is right and the credited stories elsewhere are right then all four are by Allison not Albright. Compare these faces in close up with credited Allison stories like Jesse James in Cowboy Western #38 and Chameleon in Target Comics v5#5 and with Albright stories in 4Most Comics.",19
