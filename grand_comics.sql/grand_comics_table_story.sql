This story is crudely re-purposed from an original not at all about Iwo Jima but rather an "historical" piece about the fleet assembled for the 1942 Operation "Torch" landings in North Africa. Visually there is exactly one image in five pages that has anything to do with the Pacific War and that\'s the Red Sun logo on a submarine being sunk on page four but the submarine itself is indistinguishable from the German sub sunk on page one. The rest of the backdrop is all clearly the Atlantic. The story references a fleet gathered from New York Boston and Norfolk to join an already assembled invasion fleet--that didn\'t happen at Iwo Jima--the only time a partial invasion fleet sailed direct from the US was in Operation Torch. There is a sub-plot about needing fuse casings and having them flown to the fleet en route; this actually happened in Operation Torch. In several cases the repurposing of captions or word balloons is clearly evident. The word "Japan" on page one is written in a different hand than the rest of the words in the balloon and several word balloons on page three that reference "Japs" have suspicious amounts of extra white space in them indicating production changes in the lettering.  Finally the story stops short of showing the actual bombardment and a separate two-page story (see "The Softening Up" below) had to be added to cover that. In fact the final page of the original Ken Battefield illustrated story probably appears as a one-page story in Fightin\' Navy #83 (March 1958) as "Bombardment--H-Hour -1!"  A comparison of the "The Softening Up" and that story reveals narrative similarities greater than chance would allow; the original ending of the main story had to be dropped because there were no specific references to the Pacific War and the final invasion scene is clearly US Army not US Marines hitting the beach. This very crude re-purposing of this story (and the insertion of the "The Softening Up") probably became necessary when a seven-page story originally planned to fit into the Iwo Jima sequence was grabbed at the last minute to fill a hole in another book going to press earlier (which was may have been Attack #54).', 19),

The translation from dccomics.com is "Anyway this column was running so late they had Alison Gill call and when Alison calls you better do what she asks. Now for those not familiar with DC you probably think that only Paul Levitz has that power. Obviously you never met Alison. In describing Alison Gill I feel a little like the Burl Ives snowman describing Bumbles in Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer. As Vice President of Production Alison oversees the production of every comic original graphic novel and collected edition that DC prints. Not just DCU but Wildstorm Vertigo Minx CMX... everything. Simply put without Alison and her incredibly talented and overworked staff those lovely printed comics you buy every week would be filled with blank pages hell I couldn\'t even guarantee you\'d get staples. Alison and her team allow us to push the deadline limits to make sure that you get the best book possible and that you get it on time. How else can we plan such elaborate crossovers (where timing is everything) like the ones between JUSTICE LEAGUE OF AMERICA JUSTICE SOCIETY OF AMERICA FLASH and COUNTDOWN (a time shattering story that will affect the lives of not 2 but 4 super teams) and GREEN LANTERN CORPS GREEN LANTERN and COUNTDOWN (where heroes becomes villains and villains grow more powerful). And don\'t get me started on how much extra they did to keep 52 on its weekly schedule. So I figure I best be nice after all COUNTDOWN starts the week after 52 ends (that\'s May 9th for those of you who were visiting Antarctica for the past month) and with our ambitious plan to sync up all the storytelling in the DCU for the next year so that events are seen across the universe moving in unison in "real time" we will be needing the strength and support of production more than ever. I once asked Alison how does her team do it? Magic she said. Makes sense to me.
